# Master TDD

## 21 days of writing tests. 

Testing is the one major part of development and programming I feel im rather weak at. It sounds like a good idea on paper, and I have written a few tests. But I haven't really "gotten it".  After trying to learn testing rails with tools like capybara and rspec, I've decided to simplify things and just write tests for simple programs like katas and progress from there.
